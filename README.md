# Pentest-auto-script
This script automates common tasks performed by penetration testers, such as port scanning, service enumeration, SSH brute-forcing, and web form brute-forcing. It provides a command-line interface for user interaction and streamlines the testing process.

The purpose of this project is to simplify and streamline the process of conducting penetration tests, making it easier for security professionals to identify vulnerabilities and assess the overall security posture of a target system.

## Features

1. **IP Validation**: The script validates the target IP address before carrying out any operations.
2. **Port Scanning**: Leverages `nmap` for scanning open ports on the target machine.
3. **Service Enumeration**: Uses `nmap` to enumerate services running on the open ports of the target.
4. **Brute-Force Attack**: Leverages `hydra` to conduct a brute-force attack against an ssh service on the target. A username and the path to a password list file need to be provided by the user.
5. **Web Form Brute-Force Attack**: Executes a brute-force attack on a web form on the target via `hydra`. The user needs to provide the form parameters along with a username and the path to a password list file.

## Dependencies

This script has the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Nmap
- Hydra

These tools must be installed and accessible from your system's PATH.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The script is compatible with Python 3.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine using the following command from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/marat0s/Pentest-auto-script.git
```
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the pentest_auto.py script is located:
```
cd Pentest-auto-script
```
4. Install the required dependencies. You can use pip to install the dependencies from the provided requirements.txt file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the pentest_auto.py script is located:
```
python pentest_auto.py
```
Make sure to provide the necessary command-line arguments or modify the script to suit your specific needs.
6. Follow the on-screen prompts and provide the required information, such as the target IP address or range, desired actions, etc.

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling: It validates the target IP and checks the existence of the password list file. Any errors during command execution will be printed to the console.
