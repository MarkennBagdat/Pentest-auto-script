# Pentest-auto-script
This script automates common tasks performed by penetration testers, such as port scanning, service enumeration, SSH brute-forcing, and web form brute-forcing. It provides a command-line interface for user interaction and streamlines the testing process.

## Features

1. **IP Validation**: The script validates the target IP address before carrying out any operations.
2. **Port Scanning**: Leverages `nmap` for scanning open ports on the target machine.
3. **Service Enumeration**: Uses `nmap` to enumerate services running on the open ports of the target.
4. **Brute-Force Attack**: Leverages `hydra` to conduct a brute-force attack against an ssh service on the target. A username and the path to a password list file need to be provided by the user.
5. **Web Form Brute-Force Attack**: Executes a brute-force attack on a web form on the target via `hydra`. The user needs to provide the form parameters along with a username and the path to a password list file.

## Dependencies

This script has the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Nmap
- Hydra

These tools must be installed and accessible from your system's PATH.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Execute the script from the command line:
```
python3 pentest_auto.py
```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the target IP, username, the path to the password list, and web form parameters (if applicable).

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling: It validates the target IP and checks the existence of the password list file. Any errors during command execution will be printed to the console.
